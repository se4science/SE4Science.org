### Abstract

Contemporary peer code review is a lightweight, asynchronous, tool-supported method for ensuring the quality, maintainability, and sustainability of software. While this approach has been useful in the development of traditional software, it is underutilized in the development of scientific HPC software. Because the complexity of scientific HPC software makes testing difficult, peer code review is a good option. Under the umbrella of Software Engineering for Science [https://se4science.org/](https://se4science.org/) and supported by the Better Scientific Software [http://BSSw.io](http://BSSw.io) initiative, this tutorial introduces scientific HPC developers (and students) to the concepts of code review and its tool support. After background lectures on important topics, this tutorial will provide hands-on exercise to allow attendees to become familiar with code review and its tools. First, we will provide code review tutorial and help attendees set up their GitHub account to utilize the online code review tool, Gerrit. Then attendees will participate in a hands-on exercise in which they act both as the code author and as the reviewer to become familiar with both sides of the tool. After performing the code review, we will discuss the process and help attendees understand how best to perform code reviews in the future.

### Detailed Description
* **Tutorial goals** <br>
    The goal of this tutorial is to help developers of scientific HPC software learn about the practice and tools associated with contemporary peer code review. Participants will learn how tool-based contemporary code review differs from other approaches like mailing list code reviews or pull request reviews. A secondary goal is that attendees begin to understand how contemporary code review can be applied to the development of scientific HPC software. 
* **How attendees will benefit** <br>
    The attendees will benefit by learning how to employ code review on their own projects, which will lead to both improved scientific results in the short term (through higher quality software) and in the long-term (through the more maintainable and sustainable software).
* **Targeted audience** <br>
    This tutorial will be of interest to developers of scientific HPC software who are interested in learning how to use tool-supported peer code review to improve the quality and maintainability of their software. The tutorial will also be especially valuable to students who are still learning the process of writing effective scientific HPC software.
* **Audience prerequisites** <br>
    Because the code review tool is web-based, participants will need to have their own laptop to fully participate in the tutorial. While participants will not have to install any software on their computer for the tutorial, they will need to have a github account along with command line tools for git installed. 
* **General description of tutorial content** <br>
    We will provide a lecture slide which includes the background and motivation of code review practices, the code review process in general, importance of contemporary code review practices in scientific software, discussions on code review exercises, an overview of different code review tools, and best practices of code review process. We will provide necessary documentation and demonstrate the use of a modern code review tool. We will also provide the codes for the hands-on exercises. 
* **A statement about “hands-on” exercises** <br>
    The participants will follow along with the presenter to learn the use of a code review tool. Next the participants will set-up their own GitHub account to work with the Gerrit code review tool. Next, the participants will have a hands-on experience with using the code review tool to request a review and to perform a review. 
*   **What are the benefits of the "hands-on" exercises** <br>
    These hands on exercises will have two benefits. First, participants will learn how to use the interface of a contemporary code review tool, both as a reviewer and as a code author. Second, the participants will have a chance to practice code review and discuss their experiences.
