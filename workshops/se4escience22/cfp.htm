<h2 align="center"><u>Call for Papers</u></h2>

TBD

<br>
This track will build upon previous <a href="http://SE4science.org/workshops">SE4Science</a> workshops.
Similar to the format of the previous workshops, in addition to presentation and discussion of the accepted
papers, we plan to devote significant time during the workshop to discussing important topics that arise
from the paper presentations. The goal of these discussions is to (1) develop a joint research plan that
can be conducted collectively by workshop participants and (2) development of ideas/draft of position
statements to be published externally.


<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
<!--
We encourage submissions from members of the software engineering and scientific software communities addressing
issues including but not limited to:
<ol>
	<li>Case studies of software development processes used in computational science applications;</li>
	<li>Design patterns and software architectures for computational science software;</li>
	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for computational science applications;</li>
	<li>Issues in publishing or reusing computational science research software and data;</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in computational science application development and how they might be improved; and</li>
	<li>V&V techniques specifically targeted for the scientific domain.</li>
</ol>
<br>

Please observe the following:
<ol>
	<li>Full Papers should be at most 14 pages formatted according to the <a href="https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2022/call-for-papers/">ICCS guidelines</a></li>
