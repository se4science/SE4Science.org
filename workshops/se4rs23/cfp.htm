<h2 align="center"><u>Call for Papers</u></h2>

This is a time of great growth at the intersection of software engineering and research software,
There is a need for members of the software engineering and research software communities
to share experiences, identify problems, and enumerate common goals to form the basis
for an ongoing research agenda. The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique venue for the presentation
of results and to facilitate interaction between software engineers and members of the research software community.
To address this goal, we seek contributions from members of those communities that describe perspectives,
research outcomes, and lessons learned (positive or negative) from the development of research software.

Specifically, we are interested in the software development and software engineering challenges and enablers
relating to the following topics:
<ul>
	<li>Research software applications that solve complex software- or data-intensive research problems,
		from large parallel models/simulations of the physical world using HPC systems to smaller scale simulations
		developed by a single researcher on a desktop machine or a small cluster. </li>
	<li>Applications that support scientific research and experiments at scale. Such applications include, but are
		not limited to, systems for managing and/or manipulating large amounts of data and systems that provide
		infrastructure for scientific or engineering applications such as libraries or HPC/Cloud software.</li>
	<li>The process for building, reusing, and publishing software and data used in scientific experiments
		or engineering innovations. Among others, these processes include agile approaches, open source/open
		data issues, testing scientific software, and managing software or data repositories for publishing goals.</li>
	<li>The process of theory-software translation, where loss or errors may occur due to challenges mapping between
		scientific theory and its representation in code, or between the outputs of computational research and its
		representation in theory.
</ul>

<br>
This track will build upon previous <a href="http://SE4science.org/workshops">SE4Science</a> workshops.
Similar to the format of the previous workshops, in addition to presentation and discussion of the accepted
papers, we plan to devote significant time during the workshop to discussing important topics that arise
from the paper presentations. The goal of these discussions is to (1) develop a joint research plan that
can be conducted collectively by workshop participants and (2) development of ideas/draft of position
statements to be published externally.


<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
We encourage submissions from members of the software engineering and research software communities addressing
issues including but not limited to:

	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for research software applications;</li>
	<li>Issues in publishing or reusing research software and data;</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in research software application development and how they might be improved; and</li>
	<li>V&V techniques specifically targeted for research software .</li>
</ol>
