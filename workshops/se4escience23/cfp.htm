<h2 align="center"><u>Call for Papers</u></h2>

<br>
This workshop will build upon previous <a href="http://SE4science.org/workshops">SE4Science</a> workshops.
Similar to the format of the previous workshops, in addition to presentation and discussion of the accepted
papers, we plan to devote significant time during the workshop to discussing important topics that arise
from the paper presentations. The goal of these discussions is to (1) develop a joint research plan that
can be conducted collectively by workshop participants and (2) development of ideas/draft of position
statements to be published externally.


<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

We encourage submissions from members of the software engineering and research software communities addressing
issues including but not limited to:
<ol>
	<li>Case studies of software development processes used in research software applications;</li>
	<li>Design patterns and software architectures for research software;</li>
	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for research software applications;</li>
	<li>Issues in publishing or reusing computational science research software and data;</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in research software application development and how they might be improved; and</li>
	<li>V&V techniques specifically targeted for research softwar.</li>
</ol>
<br>

Please observe the following:
<ol>
	<li>Full Papers should be at most 10 pages formatted according to the <https://www.escience-conference.org/2023/call-for-papers>eScience</a> guidelines.</li>
