We encourage submission of papers from members of the Software Engineering and 
the CSE 
communities. Papers of at most ten pages are solicited to address issues including but not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Case studies of software development processes used in CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Measures of software development productivity appropriate to CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Lessons learned from the development of CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for CSE applications.</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes 
	    used in CSE application development and how they might be improved.</li>
	<li>V&amp;V techniques specifically target for CSE applications.</li>
</ul>

In order to increase participation, we are now accepting short papers and 
position papers (2 page) position papers. These papers 
will be posted on the workshop website and may appear in the proceedings (this 
issue is still to be determined). Short papers and position papers should focus on similar topics as the full papers. 
Please 
include POSITION PAPER or SHORT PAPER in the title.<br><br>

The organizing committee hopes for participation from a broad range of 
stakeholders from across the software engineering, computational 
science/engineering, and grid computing communities. We especially encourage 
members of the CSE application community to submit practical experience papers. 
Papers on related topics are also welcome. Please contact the organizers with 
any questions about the relevance of particular topics. <br><br>

This call for papers is also available in <a href="cfp.pdf">PDF</a> format.<br />
The call for short papers and position papers is also available in
