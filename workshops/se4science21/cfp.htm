This is a time of great growth at the intersection of software engineering and computational science. There is a need for members of these communities to share experiences, identify problems, and enumerate common goals to form the basis for an ongoing research agenda. The goal of this workshop is to provide a unique venue for the presentation of results and to facilitate interaction between software engineers and computational scientists. To address this goal, we seek contributions from members of both communities that describe perspectives, research outcomes, and lessons learned (positive or negative) from the development of computational science software. Specifically, we are interested in the software development and software engineering challenges and enablers relating to:
<ul>
	<li>Computational science software applications solve complex software- or data-intensive research problems. These applications range from large parallel models/simulations of the physical world using HPC systems to smaller scale simulations developed by a single scientist or engineer on a desktop machine or a small cluster. </li>
	<li>Applications domains ranging from humanities to engineering to science.</li>
	<li>Applications that support scientific research and experiments at scale. Such applications include, but are not limited to, systems for managing and/or manipulating large amounts of data and systems that provide infrastructure for scientific or engineering applications such as libraries or HPC/Cloud software.</li>
	<li>The process for building, reusing, and publishing software and data used in scientific experiments or engineering innovations. Among others, these processes include agile approaches, open source/open data issues, testing scientific software, and managing software or data repositories for publishing goals.</li>
</ul>

<br>
			This workshop will build upon previous <a href="http://SE4science.org/workshops">SE4Science</a> workshops. Similar to the format of the previous workshops, in addition to presentation and discussion of the accepted papers, we plan to devote significant time during the workshop to discussing important topics that arise from the paper presentations. The goal of these discussions is to (1) develop a joint research plan that can be conducted collectively by workshop participants and (2) development of ideas/draft of position statements to be published externally.


<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
We encourage submissions from members of the software engineering and scientific software communities addressing issues including but not limited to:

	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for computational science applications;</li>
	<li>Issues in publishing or reusing computational science research software and data;</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in computational science application development and how they might be improved;</li>
	<li>V&V techniques specifically targeted for the scientific domain;</li>
</ol>
<br>
