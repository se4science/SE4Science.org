<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
<br>
						
	As part of an initiative supported by the Office of the Vice President of Research and Economic Development and by the UA Water Institute, we are beginning the process creating an organization that will provide software engineering/software development support to researchers across campus who use computational software in support of their research (e.g. simulations, data processing, data analysis, etc...).
	<br><br>
			
	The overall goal of this initiative is to provide resources with expertise in software engineering that will allow domain scientists (and postdocs and graduate students) to spend more of their time on their research and less on software development details.
	<br><br>

	As the first step in this process, we are holding a half-day kickoff workshop on September 28 at the Bryant Conference Center. The workshop will begin around 9AM and end after lunch. The specific goals of this workshop are:
	<ul>
		<li>Identify and gather the community of researchers at UA who develop and/or use computational software in support of their research;</li>
		<li>Provide an overview of what Research Software Engineering organizations can do in a university setting;</li>
		<li>Discuss specific software engineering/software development needs from members of the research community at UA; and</li>
		<li>Identify the benefits that such an organization can provide to the research community at UA both currently and as an asset for future hires.</li>
	</ul>

As part of the workshop, we will have participation from the following external Advisory Board members:
<ul>
	<li>Dr. David Bernholdt, Oak Ridge</li>
	<li>Dr. Ian Cosden, Princeton University (Organizes a similar group at Princeton)</li>
	<li>Dr. Daniel Katz, NCSA, University of Illinois (former NSF Program Officer for Cyber Infrastructure)</li>
	<li>Dr. Damian Rouson, Sourcery (formerly at Sandia National Laboratory)</li>
</ul> 

If you have questions or suggestions, please contact Dr. Jeffrey Carver (<a href="mailto:carver@cs.ua.edu">carver@cs.ua.edu</a>) for more information.
