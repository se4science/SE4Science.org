<h2 align="center"><u>Overview</u></h2><br>
		
High performance computing systems are used to develop software for wide variety 
of domains including nuclear physics, crash simulation, satellite data processing, 
fluid dynamics, climate modeling, bioinformatics, and financial modeling. 
The <a href="http://www.top500.org/">TOP500 website</a> lists the top 500 high 
performance computing systems along with their specifications and owners.  The 
diversity of government, scientific, and commercial organizations present on this 
list illustrates the growing prevalence and impact of HPCS applications on modern society.<br>
<br>  

Recent initiatives in the HPCS community, such as the <a href="http://highproductivity.org">DARPA High Productivity Computing 
Systems program</a>, recognize that dramatic increases in low-level benchmarks of processor 
speed and memory access times do not necessarily translate into high-level increases 
in actual development productivity. While the machines are getting faster, the 
developer effort required to fully exploit these advances can be prohibitive.  
There is an emerging movement within the HPC community to define new ways of measuring 
high performance computing systems, ways which take into account not only the low-level 
hardware components, but the higher-level productivity costs associated with producing 
usable HPC applications.  This movement creates an opportunity for the software 
engineering community to apply our techniques and knowledge to a new and important application domain.<br><br> 

Furthermore, the design, implementation, development, and maintenance of HPC 
software systems can differ in significant ways from the systems and development 
processes more typically studied by the software engineering community:
<ul>
		<li>The requirements often include conformance to sophisticated mathematical 
				models. Therefore, the requirements may take the form of an executable 
				model in a system such as Matlab, with the implementation involving 
				porting to proper platform. 
		<li>Often these projects are exploring unknown science making it difficult 
				to determine a concrete set of requirements a prioiri. 
		<li>The software development process, or "workflow" for HPC application development 
				may differ profoundly from traditional software engineering processes. 
				For example, one scientific computing workflow, dubbed the "lone researcher", 
				involves a single scientist developing a system to test a hypothesis. 
				Once the system runs correctly once and returns its results, the scientist 
				has no further need of the system. This approach contrasts with more typical 
				software engineering lifecycle models, in which the useful life of the 
				software is expected to begin, not end, after the first correct execution. 
		<li>"Usability" in the context of HPCS application development may revolve 
				around optimization to the machine architecture so that computations 
				complete in a reasonable amount of time. The effort and resources 
				involved in such optimization may exceed initial development of the algorithm.
</ul>

This workshop will bring together researchers from the software engineering community 
with researchers and practitioners from the high performance computing application 
community. The goals of this workshop are to share perspectives, present findings from 
research and practice that are relevant to HPC application development, and 
generate a research agenda to improve tools, techniques, 
and experimental methods for HPC software engineering in the future.
