<h2 align="center"><u>Overview</u></h2><br>

An important type of software that has received little attention from software 
engineering researchers is software developed for computational science and 
engineering (CS&E) applications. This software is vital for the study of many 
important topics from diverse application domains. A list of the 
<a href="http://www.top500.org/">top 500 supercomputers </A>, for which many CS&E 
applications are written, provides an example of the diversity of government, 
scientific, and commercial organizations that use CS&E and highlights its growing 
prevalence and impact on modern society. As an example of the importance and 
diversity of the types of problems addressed through CS&E, a recent article in the 
Computing Research News listed topics being addressed with CS&E at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory, including designing and maintain nuclear weapons, simulation 
of the public infrastructure, climate change, HIV vaccines, defense against 
radiological attacks, and astrophysics. In addition to these topics, other institutions 
are using CS&E to study problems related to crash simulation, satellite data 
processing, bioinformatics, and financial modeling. Because many of these 
domains are complex and involve advanced scientific or engineering concepts, 
much of the CS&E software is written by domain experts rather than by software 
engineers. This proposal uses research and education to address the lack of 
emphasis the software engineering community has placed on the development of CS&E software.

<br><br>

Furthermore, the design, implementation, development, and maintenance of CS&E 
applications can differ in significant ways from the systems and development 
processes more typically studied by the software engineering community:
<ul>
		<li>The requirements often include conformance to sophisticated mathematical 
				models. Therefore, the requirements may take the form of an executable 
				model in a system such as Matlab, with the implementation involving 
				porting to proper platform.</li>
		<li>Often these projects are exploring unknown science making it difficult to 
				determine a concrete set of requirements a prioiri.</li> 
		<li>The software development process, or "workflow" for CS&E application 
				development may differ profoundly from traditional software engineering 
				processes. For example, one scientific computing workflow, dubbed the 
				"lone researcher", involves a single scientist developing a system to 
				test a hypothesis. Once the system runs correctly once and returns its 
				results, the scientist has no further need of the system. This approach 
				contrasts with more typical software engineering lifecycle models, in 
				which the useful life of the software is expected to begin, not end, 
				after the first correct execution.</li> 
		<li>CS&E applications often require more computing resources than are 
				available on a typical workstation. Existing solutions for providing more 
				computational resources (e.g., clusters, supercomputers, grids) can be 
				difficult to use, resulting in additional software engineering challenges.</li>
		<li>"Usability" in the context of CS&E application development may revolve 
				around optimization to the machine architecture so that computations 
				complete in a reasonable amount of time. The effort and resources involved 
				in such optimization may exceed initial development of the algorithm.</li>
</ul>

The goal of this workshop is to facilitate the collaboration between software 
engineering researchers and CS&E researchers/practitioners. This workshop provides 
a forum for each side to present issues of relevance to CS&E software development. 
By bringing together these different groups our goal is to support the building of 
a common understanding of the issues involved in this complex process.
